# etcd Documentation Project Plan

This repository is created to track and share the etcd and etcd-operator documentation plan with stakeholders.

## High Level Objectives

* Create documentation for new features.
* Create documentation for UI changes.
* Respond to documentation defects on various forums.
* Create documentation for etcd-related features in other product lines

## Assumptions and Risks

* Developers' time is limited and priced
* Severity and priority of a defect or feature are not always known
* Documentation resource might need support in setting up complex test deployment

## Etcd Documentation Deliverables and Outlines

The Documentation plan is derived from discussions with the Engineering manager, Xiang Li. The following table lists the high level list of tasks and approximate timeline for completion.
