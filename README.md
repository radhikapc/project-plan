# etcd Documentation Project Plan

This repository is created to track and share the etcd and etcd-operator documentation plan with stakeholders.

## High Level Objectives

* Create documentation for new features.
* Create documentation for UI changes.
* Respond to documentation defects on various forums.
* Create documentation for etcd-related features in other product lines

## Assumptions and Risks

* Developers' time is limited and priced
* Severity and priority of a defect or feature are not always known
* Documentation resource might need support in setting up complex test deployment

## Documentation Deliverables and Outlines

The Documentation plan is derived from discussion with the Engineering. The following table lists the high level list of tasks and approximate timeline for completion.
